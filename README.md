# Description

This project is not server-public. In these codes I try out new methods for me. But it is still nice tho.

# In the latest commit...

- I fixed the error which is related to the /redeem command.
- - I fixed the static problem related to the PluginCommand.java
- I changed the Player to OfflinePlayer in the MySQL.java

# TODO

- CURRENTLY, everything is as I planned
